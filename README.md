the serialization of non-trivial data structures like numpy arrays.

# App quantile regression

This package contains the code that transforms non-probabilistic forecast methods into 
probabilistic ones:
- Gradient Boost
- linear regression
- k-neighbors
- lightgbm
- MLP (Multilayer perceptron)
- Random forests

# All data processing
